                        Why is JAY-Z one of the biggest influences in hip-hop?
                        JAY-Z has been the driving force of hip-hop since he
                        first started, with his unique blending of lyricism,
                        complex themes, and excellent production skills. He
                        brought a new meaning to rap, showing how there can be
                        great meaning behind the words. He is often seen as one
                        of the best rappers, not only because of his great
                        lyrics and albums, but also because of his ability to
                        remain relevant and produce fresh music as he ages,
                        which many rappers were unable to keep up with. JAY-Z
                        helped to make rap a part of mainstream culture through
                        his popular albums. In 2011, he broke Elvisâ€™ record for
                        most No.1 albums by a solo artist, which was a huge
                        accomplishment for hip-hop.
